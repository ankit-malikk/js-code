//immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)


(function chai(){
    //named iife

//1. IIFE is a function which immediately executes after it's creation . It is wriiten as one parentheses for wrapping the function and other for execution ()();
// 2. Variables defined inside an IIFE are not accessible from outside its scope which helps to avoid conflicts with other variables or functions (global scope pollution). Means IIFE keeps variables and functions private in it.
// 3. IIFE written with function name is named IIFE and not with name are unnamed/anonymous. 
// 4.We can use parameter inside first parentheses.
// 5. To write two or multiple IIFE one should be end with semicolon ;

//iifee means jo immententy excute hoo jayee 
// golobal scope kii pollution ssai problem hoti hai kaiyee barr tho jo declaration koi hatnaa kai liyaa iife kai use\
// 🔵The working of the JavaScript works on three phases:
// 1. Global Execution Context
// 2. Memory phase / Creation phase
// 3. Execution phase

// 🔵Phase 1: Global Execution Context
// The value of `this` keyword is set to Global Execution Context (which is an empty Object in NODE environment, & window object in browser environment)

// 🔵Phase 2: Memory phase
// During this phase, JS engine scans the code and assigns the initial values for the variables , functions, etc.. For variables they are 'undefined' and for functions they are set to their function definition

// 🔵Phase 3: Execution phase
// After the creation phase completed, the execution phase begins where actual values of the variables are set. And when the functions are called it creates a new 'Function Execution' context which consists of two phases (they works same as explained above but only for the particular function scope):
// 1. Memory phase 
// 2. Execution phase 
// 📝The return value of the 'Function Execution' context is passed to the Global Execution Context
